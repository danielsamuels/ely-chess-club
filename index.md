Ely Beet Chess Club is a well-established community club participating in the [Bury Area Chess League](https://www.buryleaguechess.org/) in Divisions 1, 2 and 3, the [Cambridgeshire League](http://www.cambschess.co.uk/) in Division 2, as well as attending various tournaments around the country. 

We are a friendly bunch comprising players of a wide range of skill levels, from beginners new to the game to seasoned veterans who have been playing most of their lives! Our club nights are hosted at the [Ely Beet Sports & Social Club](https://goo.gl/maps/abuhtTemwurBzzay6) every Monday from around 7:15 pm (including Bank Holidays) in the lounge bar, and we would love to welcome new people into the fold. Club membership for adults costs £5 a year, under 18s can play for free.

Whether it's your first time playing chess or you've been playing for a while - if you're interested in meeting a bunch of like-minded folks in the Ely area, then come along and give us a game!

If you're playing in an away match, please see our [Venues page](/venues) for details of where we play as well as useful parking information.
