  ## Welcome to the website for the Ely Chess Club
---

Ely Chess Club is a well established community club participating in the [Bury Area Chess League](https://www.buryleaguechess.org/) in Divisions 1 and 3, the [Cambridgeshire League](http://www.cambschess.co.uk/) in Division 2, as well as attending various tournaments around the country. 

We are a friendly bunch comprising of players of a wide range of skill levels, from beginners who are new to the game, to seasoned veterans who have been playing most of their lives! Our club nights are hosted at the [Ely Beet Sports & Social Club](https://goo.gl/maps/abuhtTemwurBzzay6) every Monday around 7:15pm (except for Bank Holidays) and we love to welcome new people into the fold. 

Whether it's your first time playing chess, or you've been playing for a while - if you're interested in meeting a bunch of like-minded folks in the Ely area, then come along and give us a game!
